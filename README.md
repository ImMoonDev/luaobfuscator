# luaobfuscator
Obfuscator using [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-lua/Prometheus) and lua to heavily obfuscate `.lua` files. Made for roblox script obfuscation.
PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU MUST RUN `Obf.bat` TWICE FOR IT TO WORK EVERY TIME.

## Only works with LuaU (Roblox Lua) scripts. 
You may modify the `.bat` file to change if you want to do it as Lua 5.1. (Change `--LuaU` to `--Lua51`)
